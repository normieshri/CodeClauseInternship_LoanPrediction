# CodeClauseInternship_LoanPrediction
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project on predicting loan approvals based on historical data. The project was completed during an internship at CodeClause as a Data Science Intern.



Overview:

During the internship, I developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to assess the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on various features. The project aimed to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process and minimizing the risk associated with loan defaults.
Project Structure

    Dataset: The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and comprises historical loan application data with various attributes such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
    Notebooks: The project was developed using Google Colab notebooks to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
    Modeling Techniques: Different machine learning algorithms were explored and implemented, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting techniques.
    Evaluation: The models were evaluated using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance in predicting loan approvals.

How to Use:

The code provided in the Jupyter notebooks can be used to:

    Understand the data preprocessing steps and feature engineering techniques applied.
    Train and evaluate different machine learning models for loan prediction.
    Explore and experiment with additional models or feature engineering approaches to enhance predictive performance.
